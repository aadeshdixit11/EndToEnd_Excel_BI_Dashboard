# EndToEnd_Excel_BI_Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a complete **Business Intelligence (BI) solution in Excel** using **Power Query**, **Power Pivot**, and **PivotTables**. The workflow takes raw data from multiple Excel files, transforms and models it, and delivers insights through an interactive dashboard.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Data Loading**: Import multiple Excel files from a folder using Power Query.
- **Data Transformation**: Clean, reshape, and unify datasets for consistency.
- **Data Modeling**: Establish relationships between transformed data and additional Excel sources using Power Pivot.
- **Analysis**: Create PivotTables to summarize KPIs and trends.
- **Dashboard**: Design an interactive dashboard with charts, slicers, and filters.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Excel  
- Power Query (ETL: Extract, Transform, Load)  
- Power Pivot (Data modeling with relationships and measures)  
- PivotTables & Charts  
- Dashboard Design (Interactive reporting)

## 📂 Workflow
1. **Data Gathering**  
   - Load multiple Excel files from a folder into Power Query.  
2. **Transformation**  
   - Apply cleaning, merging, and shaping operations in Power Query.  
3. **Modeling**  
   - Use Power Pivot to connect transformed data with another Excel dataset.  
   - Define relationships and create calculated measures.  
4. **Analysis**  
   - Build PivotTables to explore KPIs and trends.  
5. **Visualization**  
   - Create a dashboard with charts, slicers, and interactive elements.  

## 🎯 Use Case
This workflow is ideal for:
- Consolidating monthly/departmental reports.  
- Automating repetitive reporting tasks.  
- Building lightweight BI solutions without external tools.  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add **DAX measures** for advanced calculations.  
- Connect to **live data sources** (databases, SharePoint).  
- Extend the dashboard in **Power BI** for richer visuals and sharing.
